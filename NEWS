RcppBigIntAlgos 0.3.3 (Release date: 2020-10-04)

* Now using bitset for more efficient linear algebra.
* Also fixed additional memory issues. Confirmed fix by running rhub::check_with_sanitizers(), rhub::check_with_valgrind(), as well as running custom docker clang-ASAN.

RcppBigIntAlgos 0.3.2 (Release date: Never Release)

* Fixed ASAN/UBSAN/valgrind issue. See https://github.com/jwood000/RcppBigIntAlgos/issues/1 for more information.

RcppBigIntAlgos 0.3.1 (Release date: 2020-09-28)

* Fixed URL in README

RcppBigIntAlgos 0.3.0 (Release date: Never Released)

* Multiple threads can now be used.
* Switched completely to gmpxx. Had to copy gmpxx source and modify in order to easily build on all platforms.

RcppBigIntAlgos 0.2.5 (Release date: Never Released)

* Improved efficiency of quadraticSieve by segmenting the sieving portion. For larger number (greater than 65 decimal digits) it has a great impact.

RcppBigIntAlgos 0.2.4 (Release date: 2020-06-23)

* Fixed link in documentation in accordance with the new policy in Writing R Extensions (section: Cross-references)

RcppBigIntAlgos 0.2.3 (Release date: Never released)

* Replaced array of precalculated interval values by only calculating interval values that meet the threshold. This greatly improves efficiency.
* Refactored portions of the algorithm in preparation for parallel computing.
* Improved helper algorithm (i.e. sieveLists in SieveUtils.cc)

RcppBigIntAlgos 0.2.2 (Release date: 2020-04-19)

* Added "Free Software Foundation, Inc." as copy right holder in DESCRIPTION
* Adjusted sieving factors for improved efficiency, especially on numbers with greater than 50 digits
* Improved efficiency by utilizing more light weight data structures
* Added safety measures to ensure mpz_t arrays don't overflow

RcppBigIntAlgos 0.2.1 (Release date: Never released)

* Added references in DESCRIPTION file
* Added Mike Tryczak as contributor
* One can now see summary statistics via the showStats parameter in the quadraticSieve function

RcppBigIntAlgos 0.2.0 (Release date: Never released)

* Now uses Rcpp & RcppThread (Multiple threads are not enabled yet, but will be the focus of the next major release)
* Changed the package name to be more in line with the related RcppAlgos package
* Major overhaul of quadratic sieve algorithm
* You can now safely interrupt execution
* Removed config files and classes associated with the gmp R library
* Now uses C++11
* quadraticSieve now accepts negative numbers. It behaves similarly to gmp::factorize

RcppBigIntAlgos 0.1.2 (Release date: 2018-04-30)

* Fixed additional error found on Solaris flavor in quadraticsieve.cc

RcppBigIntAlgos 0.1.1 (Release date: 2018-04-25)

* Fixed error associated with the Solaris flavor in factorization.cc file.
* Forced complilation with C++11 on Windows build only (see Makevars.win) to address the following warnings : "ISO C++ 1998 does not support 'long long' [-Wlong-long]"
* Slightly altered factors that determine the cutoff point for sieving the log sum of the prime decomposition of the sieving interval constituents

RcppBigIntAlgos 0.1.0 (Release date: 2018-04-11)

* Initial Release
