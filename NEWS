RcppBigIntAlgos 0.2.2 (Release date: 2020-04-19)

* Added "Free Software Foundation, Inc." as copy right holder in DESCRIPTION
* Adjusted sieving factors for improved efficiency, especially on numbers with greater than 50 digits
* Improved efficiency by utilizing more light weight data structures
* Added safety measures to ensure mpz_t arrays don't overflow

RcppBigIntAlgos 0.2.1 (Release date: Never released)

* Added references in DESCRIPTION file
* Added Mike Tryczak as contributor
* One can now see summary statistics via the showStats parameter in the quadraticSieve function

* Now uses Rcpp & RcppThread (Multiple threads are not enabled yet, but will be the focus of the next major release)
* Changed the package name to be more in line with the related RcppAlgos package
* Major overhaul of quadratic sieve algorithm
* You can now safely interrupt execution
* Removed config files and classes associated with the gmp R library

* Fixed error associated with the Solaris flavor in factorization.cc file.
* Forced complilation with C++11 on Windows build only (see Makevars.win) to address the following warnings : "ISO C++ 1998 does not support 'long long' [-Wlong-long]"
* Slightly altered factors that determine the cutoff point for sieving the log sum of the prime decomposition of the sieving interval constituents
