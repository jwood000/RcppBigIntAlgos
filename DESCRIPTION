Description: Features the multiple polynomial quadratic sieve (MPQS) algorithm
    for factoring large integers and a vectorized factoring function that
    returns the complete factorization of an integer. The MPQS is based off of
    the seminal work of Carl Pomerance (1984) <doi:10.1007/3-540-39757-4_17>
    along with the modification of multiple polynomials introduced by Peter
    Montgomery and J. Davis as outlined by Robert D. Silverman (1987)
    <doi:10.1090/S0025-5718-1987-0866119-8>. Utilizes the C library
    GMP (GNU Multiple Precision Arithmetic) and 'RcppThread' for factoring
    integers in parallel. For smaller integers, a simple Elliptic
    Curve algorithm is attempted followed by a constrained version of 
    Pollard's rho algorithm. The Pollard's rho algorithm is the same algorithm
    used by the factorize function in the 'gmp' package.
