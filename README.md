# bigIntegerAlgos

Overview
---------
bigIntegerAlgos uses the C library GMP (GNU Multiple Precision Arithmetic) for efficiently
factoring big integers. For very large integers, prime factorization is carried out by a variant of the quadratic sieve algorithm that implements multiple polynomials. For smaller integers, a constrained version of the Pollard's rho algorithm is used (original code from https://gmplib.org/... this is the same algorithm found in the R gmp package (https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/gmp/gmp.pdf) called by the function `factorize`). Finally, one can quickly obtain a complete factorization of given number `n` via `divisorsBig`.

Installation
------------

``` r
install.packages("bigIntegerAlgos")

## Or install the development version
devtools::install_github("jwood000/bigIntegerAlgos")
```

Usage
-----
First, we take a look at `divisorsBig`. It is vectorized and can also return a named list.
``` r
## Get all divisors of a given number:
divisorsBig(1000)
Big Integer ('bigz') object of length 16:
 [1] 1    2    4    5    8    10   20   25   40   50   100  125  200  250  500  1000
 
 
 ## Or, get all divisors of a vector:
divisorsBig(urand.bigz(nb = 2, size = 100, seed = 42), namedList = TRUE)

It is very efficient as well. It is equipped with a modified merge sort algorithm that significantly outperforms the `std::sort`/`bigvec` (the class utilized in the `R gmp` package) combination.

```r
hugeNumber <- pow.bigz(2, 100) * pow.bigz(3, 100) * pow.bigz(5, 100)
system.time(overOneMillion <- divisorsBig(hugeNumber))

 Another benefit is that it will return correct orderings on extremely large numbers when compared to sorting large vectors in `base R`.  Typically in `base R` you must execute the following: `order(asNumeric(myVectorHere))`. When the numbers get large enough, precision is lost which leads to incorrect orderings. Observe:
 
```r
set.seed(101)
testBaseSort <- do.call(c, lapply(sample(100), function(x) add.bigz(pow.bigz(10,80), x)))
testBaseSort <- testBaseSort[order(asNumeric(testBaseSort))]
myDiff <- do.call(c, lapply(1:99, function(x) sub.bigz(testBaseSort[x+1], testBaseSort[x])))

## Should return integer(0) as the difference should always be positive
which(myDiff < 0)
 [1]  1  3  4  7  9 11 14 17 19 22 24 25 26 28 31 32 33 36 37 38 40 42 45 47 48

The Quadratic Sieve
--------------
The function `quadraticSieve` implements the multiple polynomial quadratic sieve algorithm. Currently, `quadraticSieve` can comfortably factor numbers with less than 50 digits (~160 bits).

```r
## Generate large semi-primes
semiPrime120bits <- prod(nextprime(urand.bigz(2,60,42)))
semiPrime130bits <- prod(nextprime(urand.bigz(2,65,1)))
semiPrime140bits <- prod(nextprime(urand.bigz(2,70,42)))

## Using factorize from gmp package which implements pollard's rho algorithm
## We did not test the 140 bit semi-prime as the 130 bit took a very long time

It can also be used as a general prime factoring function:

```r
quadraticSieve(urand.bigz(1,50,1))

```

However `gmp::factorize` is more suitable for numbers smaller than 60 bits and should be used in such cases.

Current Research:
-----
Improvements are being made to the section of the quadratic sieve algorithm that selects smooth numbers. Right now, we are only selecting **_M-smooth_** numbers where **_M_** is the largest prime in our sieving base. A potential efficiency gain is to also keep track of mostly **_M-smooth_** numbers (i.e. numbers that are almost completely factored by our sieving base but have one factor that contains a prime number greater than **_M_**). This way, we can obtain more smooth numbers by essentially eliminating these larger factors when we find a pair of them (N.B. square terms come out in the wash, so the large factors won't influence the outcome).

We are also working on efficiently integrating `divisorsBig` with `quadraticSieve` as currently, `divisorsBig` utilizes `gmp::factorize`.
